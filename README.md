# Valheim Armory
Valheim Armory is a continuation of Valheim Additions. A small mod designed to fill gaps in the valheim ecosystem.

The goal of this mod is to create a more diverse but not sprawling selection of weapons to make all playstyles feel fully supported at each level.


This mod is balanced to be mostly lore friendly with a preference for fun and enjoyable scaling and mechanics.

This mod is highly configurable, you can use all of it, parts or tune it as you need.

## Translations
This mod will always have an up-to-date English localization, as that is what I can provide as its author.
However, I do welcome community translations!

If you would like to contribute a new translation, or improve an existing one please feel free to reach out to me or provide a translation file in the same format as one of the existing ones.

  <summary>Boss Weapons</summary>
  
  ## Eikthyrs

    These weapons are split into two groups, one requiring the workbench and the other the forge. Meaning that some of these weapons will require metals from the black forest.

  <summary>Axes</summary>

  ### Greataxes (2H Axes)
  Battleaxes are a fun but very challenging playstyle in valheim. They are slow so you generally need to kill your opponets before they can kill you, which happens fast.

  | Blackguard Runic Daggers | Forge | Mountain | ![blackguard runic daggers icon](https://i.imgur.com/8HwWqah.png) |

  * Note: 2H Daggers will float infront of item wall mounts due to their separated attachment style. They display normally on an item stand.

  The addition of 2H daggers at lower tiers also provides you a way to focus on that playstyle all of the way up till the current end of the game.

## Configuration

Everything is optionally configurable through the ingame mod configuration UI provided by BepinEx.
  * [Thunderstore link](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/TJzilla/BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)
  * [Nexus Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/740)

Otherwise a configuration file located at `/BepInEx/config/com.midnightsfx.ValheimArmory.cfg` contains all of the configuration.

Please note that basically ALL of the configuration is server sided. Which means that **it requires a restart of your game to take effect**. This allows me to ensure that the server and the client are always in sync with the details of everything- like how much damage you did to that greydwarf.

Current configuration options:
* Damage
* Damage per level
* Recipe
* Stamina cost
* Block amount
* block per level
* Crafted amount (where applicable)

## FAQ

Q. The bronze crossbow costs dragon tears?
- A. Delete the config for the bronze crossbow (or your whole config file).


Q. Why does x weapon look bad?
- A.
	- This is my first Unity, and Valhiem mod
	- My original goal with modding was to just make a singular new arrow
	- I'm not a gamedev, I suck at textures, modeling and don't know the unity loaders
	- I'm learning as I go, and welcome feedback
	- I do this in my few hours of free time, sometimes I don't have that time

## Installation (Automatic)
Just download with your favorite modmanager!

## Installation (manual)
Toss the ValheimArmory folder and files into your plugins folder. Technically the only thing required is the ValheimArmory.ddl, configs will generate on first run.

## Changelog
**1.5.0**
```
- Added two Yagluth themed weapons
- Added configuration for block to all weapons and shields
- Updated Jotunn to 2.12.4
```

**1.4.0**
```
- Added initial bonemass boss weapons!
- First 2H warhammer added, likely slightly overpowered. This weapon acts like a 2H axe or sword, but does blunt damage.

- Updates to how localizations are added, better support for multiple languages
- Added Russian translation
```

**1.3.4**
```
- Fixed Moders crossbow not being configurable and using the wrong defaults
```

**1.3.3**
```
- Fixed wood bolt triggering the invalid recipe warning
- Fixed a particle mock for arrow feathers not resolving on some versions of valheim
- Rebalance of most boss weapons, and a few outlier non-boss weapons. Recipes are slightly more expensive overall and damage is generall down across the board.
	This primarily brings boss weapons in line with the next tier weapon minus a small bit. The balance change is just to the default config values.
	If you want to keep your weapons more powerful continue using your existing config, defaults will only be applied if you do not have a value set (new or deleted config).
